    <!DOCTYPE html>, which declares the document type.

    <html> tag, which defines the whole html document.

    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)

    <title>Colored Markers</title> element sets the title of the HTML document, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.

    <body> element contains the visible content of the HTML document, including headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, etc.

    <h1> is used for heading.

    <div> tag with container class is used to create a section which holds all the three colors which are visible on the webpage.

    Then there are three child <div> section inside that which also have their own child sections.

    <div> with class marker and red creates the red bar which is visible of the webpage, the one with class marker and green created the green bar and same as the above two is the third one with class marker and blue. We can use multiple classes for the same element, the marker element is used to specify the height and width and some other properties of that section and the other class like red, green and blue are used to color that section.

    All three of them have two child <div> sections, the first one does nothing, it's basically their to help the other section style the webapge correctly, and the second one with class sleeve is used to create the whites section the three colors visible on the webpage and style them better.
