    <!DOCTYPE html>, which declares the document type.

    <html> tag, which defines the whole html document.

    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)

    <title>Netflix | India</title> element sets the title of the HTML document, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.

    <body> element contains the visible content of the HTML document, including headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, etc.

    <div> tag with shadow class is used to create a section which is basically used to create a black background above the background image used in css, and then reduce it's opacity to make it work as a shadow.
    
    Inside the above <div> tag we have another <div> tag with maincontent class which hold all the main content of the webpage like the logo, button, and the text.

    Then we have three child <div> elements inside the <div class="maincontent"> section.

    First one with class= "mainlogo" is used to create the section which contains the logo, which is an image. So the <img> tag with class="logo" is used for the logo to insert the image.

    Second one with class="mainbutton" is used to create the section which contains the two buttons (Sign In and Register). <button class="button"> is used to create two buttons. 

    Third one with class="head1" is used to create a section which contains the text content available on the webpage. For the big heading type text, <h1> is used and for the rest <p> paragraph tag is used.


    All the class and the id used inside the elements is used in the css document to style the webpage.
